Your goal is to generate multiple document attribute extraction tasks. These tasks will help identify similar products based on a specific attribute that will be provided to you.

Each task should involve extracting an attribute that can be used to find other similar products based on the given criterion. Ensure that each task is practical, grounded in real-world use cases, and reflects considerations that are common and intuitive for a typical customer.

<step1>
Read, understand, and explain the criteria provided inside the <criteria></criteria> tags. You will include this criteria within <criteria> tags in your response.
</step1>

<step2>
Create a list of 10 varied and creative prompts for extracting a single product feature based on the selected criterion. Use a mix of:
- Commands (e.g., "Identify the...")
- Questions (e.g., "What is the...")
- Passive voice (e.g., "The feature to be extracted is...")
Each task should:
- Focus on a **single product feature**,
- Mention a **specific product category** (e.g., backpack, frying pan, water bottle),
- Use **different phrasing** and **sentence structure** for each task.
Wrap each task in <task> tags. In your response, provide the list of tasks in the following format:

<response>
  <criteria>Criteria</criteria>
  <task>First attribute extraction task instruction for Criteria</task>
  <task>Second attribute extraction task instruction for Criteria</task>
  <task>Third attribute extraction task instruction for Criteria</task>
  <task>Fourth attribute extraction task instruction for Criteria</task>
  ...
