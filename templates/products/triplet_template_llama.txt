### Instruction
You will be given a text attribute extraction description, which will be used as the criterion for similarity measurement between product descriptions. Your goal is to generate a triplet example for this task, containing the following keys:

### Keys
anchorDocument: Description of an anchor product , represented as a string of at least 50 words in English.  
negativeDocument: A modified version of the description for the anchor product. It should only differ based on the attribute specified in the task, represented as a string of at least 50 words in English.  
positiveDocument: Description of a product relevant to the anchor product based on the attribute given in the task, represented as a string of at least 50 words in English.  

### Steps
1. Read and carefully understand the text retrieval task description provided.  
2. Identify the specific similarity criteria or feature mentioned in the task that should be used to create the negativeDocument and positiveDocument.  
3. Describe the task and the similarity criteria given in the task.
4. Consider multiple options regarding your example. 
4. Generate the following example documents, adhering to the guidelines:  
    - anchorDocument: A product description of at least 50 words in English, a product description relevant to the task.  
    - negativeDocument: A modified version of the anchorDocument, differing only based on the attribute specified as similarity criteria. The modification should ensure the document remains internally consistent. It should be identical to the anchorDocument in all other aspects.
