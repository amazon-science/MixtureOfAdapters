### Instruction
You will be given a text attribute extraction task, which will be used as the criterion for similarity measurement between product descriptions. Your goal is to generate a response containing the following keys:

### Keys
negativeTask: A misleadingly similar-looking task that instead instructs the extraction of a different attribute.
positiveTask: A reworded version of the original task that still requires extracting the same attribute. It can be framed as a question or an instruction.

### Steps
1. Carefully analyze the provided task description to identify the specific attribute to be extracted.
2. Generate a negativeTask that closely resembles the original task but shifts the focus to extracting a different attribute.
3. Generate a positiveTask that rephrases the original task while keeping the attribute extraction requirement unchanged.

### Guidelines
- Describe the task and the similarity criteria given in the task before generating your response.  
- Generate realistic and natural task descriptions.
- Ensure linguistic diversity in the positive task while maintaining the core extraction requirement.
- Make the negative task appear deceptively similar while modifying the extraction focus.
- Enclose your response within `<response></response>` tags.
