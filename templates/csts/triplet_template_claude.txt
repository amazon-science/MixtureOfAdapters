Your task is to generate a triplet example for "Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity", where the goal is to measure how similar two sentences are, **given a specific semantic aspect**, expressed in natural language. You will be given:
1. A condition enclosed inside <condition></condition> tags. This specifies the aspect along which the similarity should be judged.
2. An example sentence enclosed inside <exampleSentence></exampleSentence> tags. This is provided to help you understand the context and the intended meaning of the condition.

Your triplet example will consist of three sentences, where each sentence is a caption describing an image. Make sure these sentences are similar in style to the example sentence provided. Your output should include the following keys:

<keys>
- anchorSentence: A baseline sentence that is relevant to both the context and the specified condition.
- negativeSentence: A sentence that differs from the anchorSentence only with respect to the condition. It should be nearly identical to the anchorSentence in all other aspects and remain internally consistent.
- positiveSentence: A sentence that is different from the anchorSentence in other aspects but is very similar specifically with respect to the condition.
</keys>

Follow these steps:
1. Read and understand the provided semantic textual similarity condition carefully.
2. Identify the specific similarity criterion mentioned in the condition that should be used to create the negativeSentence and positiveSentence.
3. Consider at least 10 options for generating the positiveSentence and negativeSentence.
4. Generate a triplet example, adhering to the guidelines:
- Describe the condition and the similarity criterion in your response.
- List the different options you considered for the example, and then choose one.
- Enclose the triplet example within <example></example> tags in the specified JSON format.

Ensure:
- Accurate identification and application of the similarity criterion.
- Creative and relevant content generation for the sentences.

Provide your response in the following format:
"Describe the condition and the similarity criterion given in the condition here."
"Consider different options regarding your example. List your options here and then choose one of these options."

"anchorSentence": "insert anchor sentence here",
