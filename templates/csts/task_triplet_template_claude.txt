<instruction>
You are given a condition used in a "Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity" (CSTS) task. This condition defines the specific aspect on which the similarity between sentences should be judged.

You will be provided with:
- The original condition inside <anchorCondition></anchorCondition> tags.
- An example sentence inside <sentence></sentence> tags to help clarify the context in which the condition applies.

Your task is to create two variations of the given condition:

<keys>
- negativeCondition: A deceptively similar condition that closely resembles the original in phrasing or structure, but shifts focus to a **different** attribute.
- positiveCondition: A reworded version of the original condition that preserves the **same intended attribute**.
</keys>

Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the provided condition to identify the specific attribute it targets.
2. Use the accompanying example sentence to understand the type of content the condition applies to.
3. Create a **negativeCondition** that changes the focus to a different attribute while maintaining a similar structure.
4. Create a **positiveCondition** that naturally rephrases the original while preserving the attribute.

Guidelines:
- Begin by describing the original condition and identifying the attribute it targets.
- Ensure the **positiveCondition** maintains the original intent with varied phrasing.
- Ensure the **negativeCondition** appears similar but targets a different aspect.
- Enclose your generated conditions within <response></response> tags using the specified JSON format.

Provide your response in the following format:
"Briefly explain the anchor condition and the attribute it targets, using the example sentence for reference."
<response>
{
"negativeCondition": "insert negative condition here",
"positiveCondition": "insert positive condition here"
}
</response>
